This site serves as a simple access point for learning objects associated with the Brock University Library. The learning objects featured here are meant for asynchronous, self-paced learning. They focus on skills related to library research and information literacy.

# Who

The content featured here has been created by a team of librarians at Brock University. The site is managed by the eLearning Team.

# How

In most cases, each lesson is the product of a collaborative design effort, involving many different people. During our design and ideation stage, we followed these principles for eLearning.

# Reuse

Our content is licensed under a CC-BY-NC license, meaning you can freely use and remix our content (save for commercial purposes). Toss us an attribution if you would.

# Data Collection

We collect data in two ways: the first is usage data collection through Google Analytics; the second through completely optional forms at the beginning and end of our lessons. We track engagement data through Google Analytics to give us a sense of the user’s experience on this site (bounce rates, popular content, unpopular content, referrals, etc). If you would prefer that your actions be excluded from our Google Analytics data, please install an extension for your browser (like this one for Chrome).

We track demographic and learner experience data through optional lesson surveys to help us understand our audience at a more granular level. You should not feel pressured to complete these surveys, though we appreciate any and all feedback. And please note that this data is only used for internal purposes: we will not use this data for anything other than this purpose without 1) ethics clearance and 2) participant consent.
