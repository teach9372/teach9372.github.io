transcript: '<div id="transcript" style="display: block;"><strong>Video Transcript:</strong> So, you’ve been asked to find "gray literature" for an assignment, but you’re not really sure what that is or where to look.
Consider all of the information produced by governments, financial bodies, non-profit organizations, think centers, and so on. All the literature produced by these organizations makes up grey literature.
Grey literature includes reports, policy literature, working papers, newsletters, government documents, speeches, white papers, urban plans, and so on.
Grey lit is often produced by organizations "on the ground". For that reason, grey literature can be useful and more current than literature in scholarly journals.
Some things to keep in mind regarding grey lit.
Since grey lit usually does not go through a peer review process, the quality can vary a great deal. So be sure to critically evaluate your source.
Another issue is quantity. There is so much grey literature available, it can be difficult to evaluate.
Finally, because there are no centralized ways to search, grey literature can be difficult to find systematically.
